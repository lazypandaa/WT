        <p>Student Info<br> <br>Hello, my name is Eswar Krishna, I'm 18 years old, I have completed my secondary education at Kendriya Vidyalaya Machilipatnam. My hobbies are watching movies, browsing web and social media. I'm a tech enthusiast with aspirations to work as a software developer because the only time I feel free in my life is the time I code coding is the only thing that has accepted me and it welcomes anyone with open arms no matter what you are and where you are from. As far as my family background is concerned, I am from a nuclear family of five people. My father is a real estate broker, my mother is a housewife, and I have a younger sisters who is currently in ninth standard.
